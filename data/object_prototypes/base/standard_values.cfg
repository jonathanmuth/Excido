# rationale for this file:
#  Multiple basic prototypes use these values, and previously redundantly had them as literal constants.
#  Objects based on prototypes can't refer to the properties in said prototype if they redeclare them - they frequently do to put that value in a conditional, and they have to redeclare it as yet another redundant copy of this constant.
